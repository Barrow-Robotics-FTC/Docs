Before starting to code, we need to setup the development enviroment. Some teams use OnBotJava to code, but it is very limiting and doesn't allow external packages like Pedro Pathing. To get around this, we need to use Android Studio. It can be a little more challenging to learn and set up, but it is worth the effort.

Before we start, you should know that the FTC docs for installing Android Studio are outdated. This guide is up to date as of the 2025-2026 DECODE season.

1. Download Android Studio from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
!!!
At this time of this guide, the latest version is Narwhal 3 Feature Drop
!!!
2. Use the downloaded installer to install Android Studio
!!!warning
Do not check the "Run Android Studio" option or manually run it after installation, we have more work to do.
!!!

Now that Android Studio is isntalled, let's move to the next step.
