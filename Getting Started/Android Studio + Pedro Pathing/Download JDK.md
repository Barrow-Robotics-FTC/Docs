title: Download JDK

The FTC SDK does not use the latest version of Gradle, so we need to install a JDK (Java Development Kit) to use it. The SDK uses Gradle 8.7.0, which requires JDK 17.

1. Download the appropriate JDK 17.0.12 installer from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)
2. Use the downloaded installer to install the JDK

We are now ready to open Android Studio!
